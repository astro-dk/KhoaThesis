In this study, the equation of states of (\gls{EoS}) of spin polarized neutron star (\gls{NS}) matter is investigated under the nonrelativistic Hartree-Fock (\gls{HF}) approach using 6 different realistic density-dependent nucleon-nucleon (\gls{NN}) interaction models, i.e. CDM3Y3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and BDM3Y1. Several scenarios regarding the polarization profile with baryon density are also considered, whose results are then compared with the empirical constraints obtained through astrophysical observations and nuclear structure studies.\\[5mm]
