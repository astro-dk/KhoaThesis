In this study, the equation of states of (\gls{EoS}) of spin polarized neutron star (\gls{NS}) matter under strong magnetic field is investigated under the nonrelativistic Hartree-Fock (\gls{HF}) approach using 6 different realistic density-dependent nucleon-nucleon (\gls{NN}) interaction models, i.e. CDM3Y4, 5, 6 and 8. Several scenarios regarding the polarization profile with baryon density are also considered, whose results are then compared with the empirical constraints obtained through astrophysical observations (GW170817 and GW190425) and nuclear structure studies. The symmetry energy $S$ and energy per baryon $E/A$ of symmetric nuclear matter (\gls{NM}) calculated are found to be well within the astrophysical constraint, except for CDM3Y3 and CDM3Y4 versions. The partial polarization cases ($\Delta(n_b\approx 0) < 1.0$) in scenario A is also found to be more favorable as the symmetry coefficient $J$, slope parameter $L$, curvature $K_{sym}$ and nuclear incompressibility $K$ is much closer to the newly constrained value ranges.\par
Moreover, the macroscopic properties of the \gls{NS} are also computed within the framework of General Relativity (\gls{GR}), i.e. gravitational mass $M$, radius $R$, gravito-electric and gravito-magnetic tidal Love number $k_l$ and $j_l$. Using the GW170817 constraint and the mass limit of two heaviest pulsars observed, only the CDM3Y6 and CDM3Y8 at partial polarization in scenario A remain to satisfy the observational result. The tidal Love numbers related to the tidal deformation of \gls{NS} in a binary system are calculated up to the 4\textsuperscript{th} order contribution and their values with respect to stellar mass are also discussed in details.\\[5mm]
