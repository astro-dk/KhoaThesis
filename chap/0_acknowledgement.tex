First and foremost, I want to express my greatest thank to my main supervisor, Prof. Dao Tien Khoa for his supervision of my research study, who is the first person that has inspired me to pursue the path of a theoretical physicist back in my first year of undergraduate and also give me an opportunity to work with such an interesting topic regardless of my lack of background knowledge beforehand. Secondly, I would like to give my gratitude toward my secondary supervisor Dr. Ngo Hai Tan for helping me clearing various questions and misunderstanding, as well as supporting me with her broad knowledge in the field and encouraging me to work around on my own and get better with time. Without either of their supports, I would have never been able to get involved in active research this early, let alone finishing this work in the mean time. Beside, I am also deeply grateful to my family, lecturers and friends at USTH who never stop caring and cheerfully supporting me at any moment during my period of the final internship.
