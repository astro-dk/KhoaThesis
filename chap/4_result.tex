Under the condition of \textbeta-stable, the proton's contribution $x_p = n_p/n_b$ to the baryon density of of neutrino-free \gls{NS} matter is given by Figure \ref{fig:xp}, computed with 5 different versions of the density-dependent \gls{NN} interaction. For simplicity, the baryon spin polarization $\Delta$ is assumed to be density-independent, such that it can be varied separatedly from $\Delta=0$ (spin saturated scenario) to $\Delta = 1$ (total polarization). It can be seen from Figure \ref{fig:xp} that in all cases, the higher the density, the more protons there are in the baryon composition. Furthermore, with the newly introduced parameterization of spin-dependent terms (10 and 11) in all 5 interactions, generally the protons are more abundant at higher polarization, the central density corresponding to the highest possible \gls{NS} in each interaction also tends to decrease to a comparable level for each model with such change in $\Delta$.

The density-dependent proton fraction $x_p$ is also an essential input for determining the cooling rate of the \gls{NS}, in which the dominant direct Urca (\gls{DU}) process of \gls{NS} cooling by $\nu$ emission \citep{lattimer2004physics}, i.e.
\begin{equation}
    n \longrightarrow p + e^- +\bar{\nu}_e \quad\text{and}\quad p \longrightarrow n + e^+ + \nu_e,
\end{equation}
can only take place if the proton fraction exceeds the threshold \citep{loan2011equation}
\begin{equation}
    x_{DU} = \frac{1}{ 1 + \left[ 1 + \left( \frac{n_e}{n_e + n_\mu} \right)^{1/3} \right]^3 }
    \label{eq:xDU}
\end{equation}
Note that the thresholds $x_{DU}$ determined in these calculations remain fairly unchanged in the whole range of baryon density, as well as when the polarization varies or at different models, which can be explained by the absence of interaction between leptons and baryons in the current study. The proton fraction $x_p$ in this case increases significantly as the value of $\Delta$ rises from $0\to 1$ and surpasses the \gls{DU} threshold at much lower density of $\gtrsim 3n_0$. Beside, the electron fraction infered by this result might also reach up to $\gtrsim 20\%$ at $\Delta$ approaching $1$, which is fairly compatible with the observed quantity $27\%$ from the blue kilonova ejecta following the GW170817 event \citep{abbott2017gw170817, evans2017swift} and can very possibly come from a magnetar as suggested by \cite{metzger2018magnetar}.\par
